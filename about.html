## About

I am currently a Machine Learning Researcher at Oracle Labs, Vancouver, Canada. I earned my Ph.D. in 2015 from Simon Fraser University under the supervision of Dr. Greg Mori. I did my internship at Disney Research in fall 2013, and SAP from fall 2014 to spring 2015. I am interested in machine learning research, and the focus is to develop machine learning algorithms and semantic representations for high-level understanding of image, video and network data.
